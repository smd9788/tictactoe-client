This project builds a tic-tac-toe game in the browser.

Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- AJAX requests from preconfigured API

Process:
I started by building a base HTML template as to serve as a foundation for my DOM
manipulation. The gameboard is stored as an array, each players moves build their
own array. The game logic then compares each players array to the win condtions
array to determine a winner.

Unsolved Problems/Missing features:
1. messaging system for when an invalid move is made.
2. Game API functionality. I need to implement game saving and statistics per requirements.
3. Clean up asthetics and CSS
4. Create computer AI
5. Create multiplayer mode
