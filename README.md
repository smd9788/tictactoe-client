# Tic-Tac-Toe

#### UPDATE: As of 4/28/18 I have stripped out the authentication functionality from the deployed app.

The is the first JavaScript app I developed. It is exactly what you think it is. A very clean, and visually pleasing way to play Tic-Tac-Toe on your local machine. This is a front end project, where I utilized a third party API, developed by General Assembly.
